# demand-comp-cntry
A competition for forecasting electricity demand at the country-level using a standard backtesting framework

## Introduction
This repo makes scripts available for downloading and compiling country-level data to be used in electricity demand forecasting at the country level. The goal of this repo is to encourage collaborative and competitive efforts towards the use of machine learning backtesting frameworks for forecasting electricity consumption and to use trained models to predict future consumption at the country-level. The results of such models can be used directly as input to the [pypsa-africa](https://github.com/pypsa-meets-africa/pypsa-africa) repository and other similar modeling efforts. 

## Technical Background
